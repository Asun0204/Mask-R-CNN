## Training

# 2. Fine-tune all layers. For this simple example it's not necessary, but we're including it to show the process. Simply pass `layers="all` to train all layers.

# Train the head branches
# Passing layers="heads" freezes all layers except the head
# layers. You can also pass a regular expression to select
# which layers to train by name pattern.
